# TravelWise-Chatbot-With-RAG-Using-Agent-from-LangGraph

## Introduction:
Hello everyone, in this project we'll develop a Retreival Augmented Generation workflow using Agents from LangGraph.
This project will help you to understand the basic of Adaptive RAG and Agents in LangGraph and also provide a real world example of Agents.

## Goal of The Project:
The aim of this project is to improve the traveling experience of tourists visiting New York City by providing general and up-to-date information about the city.
With this application, tourists will be able to get answers to general questions such as 'Where is the Empire State Building?' or 'What should I eat in Chinatown?' as well as up-to-date questions such as 'What are the subway ticket fares in New York?' or 'What is the weather like in New York City?'
